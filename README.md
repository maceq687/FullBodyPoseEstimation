# Full Body Pose Estimation
Aim of the project is to achieve a full body controllable avatar in VR environment (Unity). Head and hands are tracked using HMD (Quest2) with two controllers while tracking of the rest of the body is achieved using different techniques.  
Those techniques include:  
- Neural network based pose estimation using a webcam ([BlazePoseBarracuda](https://github.com/creativeIKEP/BlazePoseBarracuda))
- Depth map based pose estimation using [Kinect v2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect/)

Full body rig solution created based on solution from [ThreeDPoseUnityBarracuda](https://github.com/digital-standard/ThreeDPoseUnityBarracuda) project.
